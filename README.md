## Welcome to Skiff Mail!

Skiff Mail empowers free and more effective communication through private, end-to-end encrypted email. All messages sent between Skiff users are end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, Skiff never stores unencrypted access to messages sent or received from external mail providers.
